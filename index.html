			<img src="Rathalos.jpg" alt="a still image from the 3d digital game monster hunter of three hunters fighting a rathalos in the ancient forest. the hunter in front is using a switch axe, another hunter farther up front to the left with a hammer, and the third hunter on the right, behind some bones so only his upper body is visible, hitting the rathalos with a lance making sparks fly. the rathalos is diving towards the camera mouth open and talons ready to strike.">
